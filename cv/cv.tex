\subtext{Spokane Predictive Analytics and Master's Thesis Project \hfill Spokane, WA}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item Established specific research questions.
    \item Received, matched, and preprocessed de-identified data from multiple files using Python.
    \item Performed data exploration on the 91,591 rows using multiple types of correlation and data visualization to determine relationships within the data with Python.
    \item Engineered new cumulative features.
    \item Investigated longitudinal approaches with Linear Regression, Cox Proportional Hazards, and LSTM models as well as non-longitudinal approaches with Logistic Regression and Vanilla ANN models using Python.
    \item Evaluated and compared models based on their Receiver Operator Characteristic curves. The Logistic Regression model performed best with an Area Under the Curve of 0.81 - similar to current research.
    \item Utilized K-Folds and minority class oversampling to combat extreme data imbalance (0.39\% positive cases).
    \item Presented findings to the City Council of Spokane and defended as master's thesis.
