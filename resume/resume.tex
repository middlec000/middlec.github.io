\section{Education}
\subsection{{Master of Science in Applied Mathematics  \hfill September 2019 --- June 2021}}
\subtext{Eastern Washington University \hfill Cheney, WA}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item GPA: 4.0
    \item First graduate of reopened program (2021)
    \item Outstanding Graduate Award (2021)
    \item Graduate Service Appointment (2020 - 2021)
\end{zitemize}

\subsection{{Bachelor of Science in Mathematics \hfill September 2013 --- December 2017}}
\subtext{Western Washington University \hfill Bellingham, WA}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item GPA: 3.5
    \item Minors: Chemistry
    \item Honors Program Graduate
    \item Math Fellow (2015 - 2017)
    \item Presidential Scholarship (2013)
\end{zitemize}

\section{Project Experience}
\subsection{{Data Science Lead / Homelessness Prediction \hfill June 2020 --- June 2021}}
\subtext{Spokane Predictive Analytics and Master's Thesis Project \hfill Spokane, WA}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item Established specific research questions.
    \item Received, matched, and preprocessed de-identified data from multiple files using Python.
    \item Worked with data providers to iteratively improve datasets.
    \item Performed data exploration on the 91,591 rows using multiple types of correlation and data visualization to determine relationships within the data with Python.
    \item Engineered new cumulative features.
    \item Investigated longitudinal approaches with Linear Regression, Cox Proportional Hazards, and LSTM models as well as non-longitudinal approaches with Logistic Regression and Vanilla ANN models using Python.
    \item Evaluated and compared models based on their Receiver Operator Characteristic curves. The Logistic Regression model performed best with an Area Under the Curve of 0.81 - similar to current research.
    \item Utilized K-Folds and minority class oversampling to combat extreme data imbalance (0.39\% positive cases).
    \item Presented findings to the City Council of Spokane and defended as master's thesis. 
    \item Paper pending publication in a peer reviewed journal.
\end{zitemize}

\subsection{{Software Engineer / Academic Paper Clustering by Topic \hfill January 2021 --- March 2021}}
\subtext{Big Data Analytics Class Project, Eastern Washington University \hfill Spokane, WA}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item Established a data preprocessing pipeline that pulled the body of each paper, detected the language - only retaining English documents, tokenized and lemmatized each text, then converted all documents to sparse vectors of TF-IDF scores using Python.
    \item Assisted with development of a customized K-Means algorithm optimized for sparse, largely disjoint TF-IDF vectors.
    \item Developed algorithm component to determine number of clusters to form using the Elbow Method.
    \item Currently working on publishing a fast hierarchical text document clustering Python package as an extension of this work.
\end{zitemize}
