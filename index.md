# Welcome to my Personal Website!
My name is Colin Middleton and I am currently looking for work in the field of Data Science.  

# About Me
## Education
* MS Applied Mathematics from Eastern Washington University, June 2021  
* BS Mathematics from Western Washington Universtiy, December 2017  

## Interests
* Personalized Medicine - Each one of us is different. We often present different symptoms for the same condition and we respond differently to the same medicine. Data is the answer - we need to learn what information determines these differences and find ways to collect it non-invasively.   
* Homelessness Prevention - Preventing individauls from experiencing homelessness is more humane and cost effective than waiting to assist people only after they have lost their homes. 
* Data Science Tools - I am always learning new tools to help me investigate and visualize data, fit models, and present results.  
* Outdoors - Currently living in Alpine, Wyoming and enjoying exploring the surrounding mountains by foot and ski.

# Portfolio
## [Predicting Homelessness](https://github.com/middlec000/SPA_predict_homelessness)
Used Logistic Regression to predict an individual's risk of experiencing homelessness based on their utility payment history.  
Tools: Python (pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scikit-learn, matplotlib)

## [Document Clustering](https://github.com/middlec000/cord19clustering)
Helped build a customized K-Means model that clusters a collection of text documents into groups based on topic.  
Tools: Python (dictionaries, lists, custom objects and methods)

## [One-Way ANOVA Streamlit Website](https://share.streamlit.io/middlec000/grades_vs_student_characteristic/main/src/main.py)
Upload your data, group it by a categorical column, then analyze if there is a statistically significant difference in means of a continuous column between groups. Example provided.  
Tools: Python (streamlit, pandas, statsmodels)

## [Wine Quality Classification](https://github.com/middlec000/wine_quality)
Used a Random Forest to classify wine as one of six quality rankings based on given attributes.  
Tools: R (Hmisc, corrplot, randomForest, caret, ggplot2)

## In Development
Check out my [GitHub Profile Page](https://github.com/middlec000) to see all my projects. These include:
* Fast heirarchical document clustering  
* Stepwise linear model building in Python
